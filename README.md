# auto_expense_tracking
A colaboratory Python snippet for auto-importing and formatting the accounts' transactions into a structured expense tracker.

## Pre-set
1. For security reasons, it is expected not to use the API directly to pull sensitive account information. The user must first upload the relevant account statements onto Google Drive so this snippet can read and process the data.
2. This Python file is designed to only simplify importing and formatting the transactions from each bank account, into a structured Google spreadsheet expense tracker for further review.
